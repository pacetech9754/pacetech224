            <h2 class="diagonals">History</h2>
            <p>Originally founded in 1894, Pacetech Inc has had a long standing reputation with an old fashioned approach in how we conduct business, which all of our customers are treated with respect, and always with a smile.

            Pacetech is a unique company that takes an old fashioned method in doing business with its employees and customers. Firstly, our company encourages employees to be innovative, and our philosophy also has an open door policy with management.
                
            Secondly, Pacetech takes quality seriously. Quality control procedures enable Pacetech to ensure that each and every product that we offer is of the highest standard, and Pacetech continually monitors and tests products to maintain the highest levels of quality for our customers.
                
            Pacetech meets the specific needs of all customers by offering completely individualized service. Whatever the needs of a retail, or Enterprise customer, Pacetech responds quickly through its sales representatives. Orders are processed on a single delivery, single invoice basis. This eliminates costly paper work, and follow-up inquires.

            <h2 class="section title">Mission & Vision</h2>
            <p>Pacetech Companies, Inc. may look like a big company; however our operating and management philosophy is founded on the principles of respect and honor, and we feel that service should be of the highest standard possible, and that we treat our employees, vendors and customers with the respect they deserve. Pacetech has fought hard to ensure that this company remains true to its convictions and does not waiver from them. Pacetech Companies, Inc. has always believed in an old fashioned approach to doing business, and lives by the old code of treating each other as individuals, promoting from within the company, encouraging employees to better themselves and evaluating employees on their merits. Pacetech also believes in an open-door policy on ideas and suggestions that help the company and fellow employees. No one in the company should feel left out and marginalized, and suggestions and input from all employees is welcomed and encouraged.

                <em>As our company grows, and new companies join the Pacetech family, it is important to note that Pacetech always strives to retain existing management and employees of these new companies, and Pacetech management is also careful to evaluate the existing business practices of new companies to see how well they will fit in with the Beatrice standards, and then adopt them. Unfortunately, other companies that acquire other businesses tend to bring in their own people with little regard for the existing management and employees, which can be very disruptive, and damage the reputation of the existing business. Pacetech believes in nurturing the businesses that are part of our family, and allowing each operating group to share in the benefit of being part of Organization.</em>

            <p>

                Pacetech Scanning and Imaging specializes in the full document management process and that includes document shredding. We understand that the lifecycle of documents doesn’t end until it’s thoroughly destroyed. To protect your private business information, we recommend shredding any document containing personal or private information about your company, customers, and employees.
                
                Every document has an expiration date. Rather than store thousands of documents with outdated information, hire a shredding professional to shred your files to unrecoverable bits and keep your private information secure.
